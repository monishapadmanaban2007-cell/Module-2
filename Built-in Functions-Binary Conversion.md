## NAME: MONISHA P
## REF NO: 25018486
## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
a=16

binary_value=bin(a)

print("decimal number:",a)

print("Binary representation:",binary_value)

## Output
Decimal number: 16

Binary representation:  0b10000
## Result
The decimal number 16 is successfully converted into its binary representation using the build-in bin()function in Python.
The binary equivalent of 16 is 10000.
